          <p>
            My vision for AFCAI is to bring all football clubs and academies in
            India under one umbrella so that the new and entry level clubs can
            learn from, get guidance from the experience and expertise of the
            established clubs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The established clubs will benefit from guiding and mentoring new,
            smaller clubs as it will lead to over all development of football in
            their region, and possibly even help to scout players and other good
            professionals from smaller clubs. The idea is to create a platform
            for clubs and academies to support, guide and help each other grow.
            The organisation will stand for the rights of every club or academy
            in India which is honestly doing the good work of promotion of the
            sport so that they do not have to face any problem alone.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-gray-500">
            What plans does AFCAI have for the year?
          </p>
          <p>
            We foresee a busy year ahead with various online and offline
            seminars, courses, learning camps for array of things like social
            media, marketing, scouting, club operations, club structure,
            accreditation, club licensing etc. The idea is to keep members of
            the organisation engaged year round and allow for maximum
            opportunities for idea exchanges, interaction and networking.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-gray-500">
            How will AFCAI involve its members?
          </p>
          <p>
            As this is a voluntary organisation, all members will be valuable
            stakeholders. The members will have direct access to a wide network
            of industry professionals for anything and everything needed to run
            a football club. We already have volunteer mentors and specialists
            in the fields of media, marketing, sponsorships, operations, legal
            etc. Additionally we intend to set up an open forum for all clubs
            and academies who are facing problems of any kind. We intend to
            provide them with the expertise to overcome any obstacles. It will
            be a one stop solution for clubs and academies.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-gray-500">
            How can Clubs and Academies of India be protected?
          </p>
          <p>
            The only way clubs and academies interests can be protected is if we
            unite them through a common platform like the AFCAI. Most
            federations and organisations try to pit the clubs and academies
            against each other. Rivalry is good on the field but, united we
            stand and divided we fall. We cannot see each other as competition,
            we must see ourselves as comrades who are united for the common goal
            of development of football.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-gray-500">
            How was the idea of AFCAI born?
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time in India football, I realised that clubs and
            academies are the true lifeblood of the footballing ecosystem of the
            country. Not to mention the investments made by them which are
            sustaining the football in the county. They are the ones doing the
            hard and dirty work at the ground level to sow the seeds of the game
            far and wide. Yet these most important stakeholders are seldom
            consulted, often ignored and sometimes even victimised. We already
            have a players association and a coaches association, but there is
            no representation of clubs and academies united. Upon doing some
            research I found that such organisations already exist in countries
            like Australia, US, all over Europe and around the world. We drew
            inspiration from them, and thatâ€™s how AFCAI was born.
